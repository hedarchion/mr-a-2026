# Instructional Slide Decks

Build a deck for a teacher operating one shared classroom display. Treat slides as a focused teaching surface, not a document or self-paced course.

## Resolve the operating frame

Infer before asking. Use the explicit request, target lesson folder, recent same-class decks, `copu_classes_full.json`, timetable, and workspace defaults in that order. Establish the class, objective, prior learning, lesson date, duration, week, language level, target viewport, and requested deliverables. Ask one concise question only when unresolved ambiguity materially changes the result. Never invent a class.

Lesson continuity is part of the operating frame, not a decorative opener. Some lessons happen offline or outside this app, so local deck history may be incomplete. When the most recent same-class files do not clearly establish the previous lesson, ask the teacher what was taught before, what students seemed to understand, and what must be bridged into the new lesson.

Default to `1366 × 768`, 16:9. Continue at `1280 × 665` when the class's existing deck uses that viewport. Fix the canvas at the selected size, scale it to the browser window, and keep all essential content and controls above the fold.

For Form 1 classes, `1 Devotion` / `class-1d`, and `2 Devotion` / `class-2d`, design for laptop-to-smart-TV projection rather than a smartboard unless evidence says otherwise. Prefer shorter visible copy, larger interaction targets, stronger contrast, and more slides over dense text. Treat text legibility as a content requirement.

Create work at:

```text
decks/<class-slug>/<YYYY>/week-<NN>/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<topic-slug>/
├── index.html
├── assets/
└── notes.md
```

Keep worksheets and keys aligned to the deck in the same lesson folder. Keep reusable assets in `templates/`.

## Build a compact context pack

Before drafting, inspect the most recent relevant same-class deck and notes. Capture internally: objective, prerequisite knowledge, prior coverage, likely misconception, class-level scaffolding need, duration, display, source evidence, and durable preferences from `learning/user-preferences.md`. Do not make the user restate discoverable context.

Read [references/class-data.md](references/class-data.md) before using `copu_classes_full.json`. Use aggregate data only. Never embed rosters, names, individual scores, tiers, or the class JSON in a publishable deck. Use `teacher-tools/name-picker/index.html` in a private teacher window when needed.

Use Form 1 **A2 Revise** and Form 2 **A2 High** language targets unless the user overrides them. Differentiate through modelling, prompts, task demand, and optional extension—not public labels.

## Ground grammar accurately

For grammar or language-form lessons, query the private workspace-root `grammar for english teachers.md.md` before writing explanations, examples, distractors, or feedback:

```text
node instructional-slide-decks/scripts/search-grammar-book.mjs "<topic or contrast>" --objective "<learning objective>" --misconception "<likely error>" --limit 5
```

Run separate queries for the central rule, contrast, and likely misconception. Read the strongest distinct heading paths and adjacent passages; record the headings and line numbers in `notes.md`. Prefer explanatory and learner-difficulty sections over index entries, contents tables, or answer keys. Translate evidence into concise original A2-appropriate teaching; do not publish the book or copy long passages.

If no relevant evidence appears after related terminology and misconception queries, inspect the table of contents and headings directly. Ask for another source or permission to proceed without book grounding only after both routes fail.

## Ground non-grammar English pedagogy

For English lessons or assessments outside grammar, such as listening, reading, writing, speaking, vocabulary, genre, comprehension, test design, or rubrics, do not rely on memory alone when the local materials do not cover the pedagogical decision. Search authoritative web sources, official curriculum or exam guidance, or reputable language-teaching references. Record sources in `notes.md`, then adapt the findings into concise A2-appropriate activities, prompts, and teacher notes.

## Plan the learning sequence

Read [references/instructional-design.md](references/instructional-design.md) while mapping or reviewing a lesson.

Reserve the first 5–10 minutes of a new lesson for 2–4 retrieval prompts, including at least one explanation or application. Bridge the evidence explicitly into the new objective rather than reteaching the prior lesson.

Sequence prior knowledge → bridge → model → guided practice → check → explanatory correction → transfer. Give each slide one visible teaching move and one dominant learning question or action. Split dense ideas instead of shrinking type. Keep teacher talk tracks, wait time, anticipated responses, and transitions in `notes.md`.

## Design the projected surface

Use the smallest visual system that makes the teaching move obvious. Prefer one composition, strong hierarchy, high contrast, and direct examples over decorative panels or generic chrome. Use Tailwind CSS for layout and state styling, with custom CSS only for canvas scaling, reusable behavior, and necessary animation.

Design for pupils who are nearsighted by default: at least 28 px body text, 34 px questions, and 38 px slide titles at the target viewport. Do not rely on color alone, muted gray, thin strokes, low-opacity text, or interaction below the navigation safe zone.

Support `ArrowLeft`, `ArrowRight`, and `Space`, plus visible previous/next controls and a clear slide indicator.

## Add formative interactions

Read [references/formative-interactions.md](references/formative-interactions.md) when adding interactions. Use the smallest interaction that reveals useful thinking: predict/reveal, choose, order, categorise, complete, or error analysis.

Every interaction needs a prompt, response path, teacher-controlled check or reveal, explanatory feedback, reset, keyboard access, and non-digital fallback. Visible controls that do not change state are failed interactions, not decoration. Refactor inherited slide code or shared button handlers when needed so the actual click and keyboard paths work. Avoid scores, timers, confetti, accounts, and competitive mechanics unless they directly serve the objective.

## Align worksheets

Read [references/worksheet-templates.md](references/worksheet-templates.md) before authoring worksheet HTML. Reuse the matching scaffold under `templates/worksheet-html/`, keep content in its separate input file, and render the final self-contained learner HTML instead of rebuilding stable structure. Apply the coded title there for every lesson-related worksheet. If a subtitle is useful, keep it content-only; omit learner-facing difficulty, process, or task-type annotations such as `Easy`, `Revision`, `Practice`, or `Error Correction` unless the user explicitly requests them or the official assessment format requires them.

Interpret `2 in 1` as the teacher's shorthand for duplicating a one-page worksheet as two identical document pages. The resulting file is intended for `2 pages per sheet` printing and cutting into two complete learner copies; preserve a one-copy override.

For Paper 1 Part 2, reuse `templates/worksheet-html/paper-1-part-2/` and change only the content JSON. Default to question numbers 9–16 after Paper 1 Part 1 and make the answer-table number columns extremely narrow so corrected-word spaces receive most of the width.

When a worksheet is requested, also use the `worksheet-assessment-design` skill. Default unspecified administration to brief, individual, formative, ungraded, teacher-marked work with ordinary classroom supports; record the assumption rather than stopping the build.

For an English Paper 1 or Paper 2 part assessment, read its corresponding workspace-root `paper-<paper>-part-<part>-*.md` guide before drafting. Confirm the form, use the guide's format and CEFR level, produce the answer key or rubric with the learner task, and complete its item-specific validation. Keep official-format requirements separate from UASA model-paper conventions in `notes.md`.

When the requested assessment is Form 1 English **Paper 1 Part 3** or **Information Transfer**, read the workspace-root `paper-1-part-3-information-transfer.md` as the primary format reference. It governs the task architecture: a CEFR A2 linear passage, eight semantic fields in a table or graphic organiser, eight one-mark dichotomously scored items, and normally source-lifted answers of no more than three words and/or a number. Keep official KPM requirements distinct from UASA conventions in `notes.md`. Plan the eight target facts before drafting the passage; include controlled competing information in several items, ensure each field has a single defensible answer, and document canonical and accepted answers.

When the requested assessment is English **Paper 1 Part 5** or **Gapped Text**, read the workspace-root `paper-1-part-5-gapped-text.md`. Confirm whether it is Form 1 or Form 2 and use the appropriate option architecture. Draft a complete linear passage first; remove only sentences whose replacement requires bidirectional contextual cohesion. Verify each gap against every option, use plausible Form 2 distractors, reject ambiguity, reconstruct the original passage, and deliver the answer key. Treat this as a reading and discourse-cohesion task, not grammar gap fill.

Derive worksheet outcomes from the deck objective and taught practice. Build the blueprint and key/rubric together. Use fresh examples, sample important outcomes more than once when practical, and keep learner material separate from scoring guidance. Ensure slide instruction, exit evidence, worksheet items, and scoring rules make the same learning claim.

After verification, mirror every completed worksheet set into `/Users/copu/Documents/Worksheets 2026/Archive/`. Preserve the lesson originals, but exclude HTML from the archive; keep worksheet HTML in the lesson repository and mirror only its printable PDF plus the key/rubric, content input and useful non-HTML editable source. Group those files under the same coded folder, use role suffixes that make each file's purpose obvious, and update the central `INDEX.md` and `catalog.csv`. Never invent a missing date or week; use `UNDATED` and `Unscheduled` and record the limitation.

## Verify before delivery

Inspect every slide at the exact viewport, including answer, error, reset, and final states. Fix clipping, overlap, wrapping, below-fold content, tiny text, broken focus, inaccessible controls, and navigation faults. Check that every slide advances the objective and that feedback explains the reasoning.

For a worksheet, verify outcome coverage, item clarity, answer defensibility, distractor plausibility, scoring consistency, fairness, accessibility, and the stated limits of an unpiloted instrument. Cross-check all answers against the learner version. For Information Transfer, additionally verify exactly eight gaps and eight marks; that every canonical answer is a short, preferably contiguous span in the passage; uniqueness of each table field; varied semantic categories; A2-appropriate language; and that the table cannot be completed reliably by keyword matching alone.

## Learn from use

When the user comments on an artifact or reports student response, read [references/feedback-learning.md](references/feedback-learning.md). Apply requested revisions, record the evidence, and update durable preferences without waiting for the phrase “update the skill.” Promote only well-supported, reusable lessons; do not turn one-off content choices into universal rules. Validate the skill after any change and briefly disclose durable improvements to the user.
